## Description
There's something in the building. Can you retrieve the flag?

## Hints
There is data encoded somewhere... there might be an online decoder.

## Solution
It is clear from the hint that data is encoded with the image by steganography.    
So we need to use steganography decoder.   
Let's use online steganography decoder https://stylesuxx.github.io/steganography/   
Upload image on the website and flag will be in the Hidden message section of the website.   

## Flag
