## Hints
The flag is in the format PICOCTF{}

## Solution
After seeing the image, I immediate;y realize that flag should be something like PICOCTF{F????????T?FF}   
I thought that it could be flag of different countries and flag could be first letter of country name.  
So I searched like flag with red, white and blue color, Yellow flag with black dot.  
I assumed that country name of first flag should start with P because according to hint The flag is in the format PICOCTF{}  
I tried to dig up but this didn't worked.   
Then, I googled flag with red diamond in the middle  
I found that flag in the below URL (ICS flag foxtrot)  
https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Gallery_of_flags_with_diamonds  
So I got PICOCTF{F?A??AND?TUFF}  
Though other alphabets are remaining so I searched for ICS flag and got   
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_maritime_signal_flags  
After visiting this page I got complete flag.  

## Flag
