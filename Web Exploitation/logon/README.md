## Hints    
Hmm it doesn't seem to check anyone's password, except for logon's?

## Solution    
Open link    
It's always going to login, no matter what credential we use.     
Enter any credential then capture that request in burp suite.    
Notice that cookie admin is set to False, change it to True to get a Flag.
