## Description
If I told you a word started with 0x70 in hexadecimal, what would it start with in ASCII?

## Hints
Submit your answer in our flag format.      
For example, if your answer was 'hello', you would submit 'picoCTF{hello}' as the flag.

## Solution

Enter 0x70 in Hex(bytes), we get p in the ASCII text

## Flag
picoCTF{p}
