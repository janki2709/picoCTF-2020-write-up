## Description
Can you find the flag in file?   
This would be really tedious to look through manually, something tells me there is a better way.

## Hints

## Solution
It is clear from the hint that we need to grep command.   
Grep is a Linux / Unix command-line tool used to search for a string of characters in a specified file.  
So use commmand which is given below to get the flag   
grep picoCTF file  
This command will search for string starting with picoCTF in file  

## Flag
picoCTF{grep_is_good_to_find_things_5af9d829}
